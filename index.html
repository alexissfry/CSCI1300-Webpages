            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p class="proj-body">
              Although Pastiche truly sells impeccable pastries, their website
              is difficult to navigate and learn, has accessibility issues, is
              not responsive, and fails to embody the coziness and European
              essense of this Federal Hill staple.
            </p>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p class="proj-body">
              The objective of this redesign is to make Pastiche's corner of the
              internet embody the experience of walking into their shop‚Äîthe
              smell of butter and sugar wafting from freshly baked pastries and
              the intricate painted murals of rolling green hills‚Äîto invite new
              and loyal customers alike inside. Another goal make sure that no
              component of the site is outdated and that there is a modern feel
              throughout, which which will ensure that this 40-year old bakery
              is able stay relevant in our increasingly digital world.
            </p>
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p class="proj-body">
              This project exclusively focuses on redesigning the homepage of
              Pastiche's website, which is why some clickable links are just
              simulated.

                The <strong>navbar text is difficult to read</strong> when

              <li>
                The interface is <strong>not responsive</strong> when minimized

              <li>
                The most important information, such as hours and ordering
                information, is <strong>cluttered in the center</strong> of the
                interface and such information lacks clear outlines or borders

                The <strong>footer has missing content</strong> in some

                There is a significant <strong>lack in contrast</strong> between
                the light gray text and white background at the center of the
                interface; this lack of contrast is also apparent with the

              The starting, 9-box sketch was an opportunity to ideate and put
              pen to paper on any landing pages that came to mind for Pastiche!
              After reflecting on my initial, rough ideas, I gravitated towards
              a very minimalistic landing page that embodied the European-style
              of Pastiche and invited users to continue scrolling.
            </p>
            <p class="proj-body space-bottom">
              When approaching the final sketch, I knew that I wanted to present
              photos of not just the desserts Pastiche sells but the store
              itself and its history early on. Then, I focused on making sure
              there were clear divisions between information throughout. This
              step gave me a thorough mental model of what I wanted to
              accomplish in the low-fidelity wireframes.

            <h2 class="space-bottom">Low-fidelity Wireframes</h2>

            <p class="proj-body space-bottom">
              The low-fidelity wireframes were created using Figma and were
              essential in the process of refining the design to make sure I was
              addressing user pain points identified during research and
              planning out responsiveness across desktop and mobile interfaces.
              Then, I was able to move onto making all of my ideas come to life
              in the high-fidelity wireframes and standardizing my entire
              interface through the style guide.

              historic, European-style bakery shop. Certain components of the
              interface were designed intentionally to accomplish my objective:
              <ul class="body-text">
                <li><strong>Title and section header font:</strong> Sticking with the original "Pastiche" logo font allows consistentcy throughout the interface and gives a established feel </li>
                <li><strong>About section image carousel and text: </strong> The description alongside images of Pastiche's storefront, bakers, and interior immediately give the users an understanding of the bakery and what it has to offer</li>
                <li><strong>Favorites section cakes and order button: The floating nature of the cakes allow users to easily view customer favorites and the constrasting, centered order button gives an easy solution for users to satisfy their sweet tooth</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Complete, scaled footer:</strong> The completeness and organization of the footer decreases user confusion and presents information that is easy to understand and interact with </li>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="proj-body">
              I found this project to be quite challenging and time-intensive
              given that it was my first time using Bootstrap and media queries!
              At the same time, the process of redesigning an interface was
              really rewarding. More specifically, I really enjoyed the process
              of researching and designing a digital interface from square zero
              to a relatively functional and responsive final website. I found
              it especially satisfying because I am often frustrated how I
              cannot provide direct feedback when interfaces frustrate me. I
              loved how I could take it into my own hands with this project, and
              I also learned really useful UX principles through the process of
              doing and iterating.
